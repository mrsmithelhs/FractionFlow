# FractionFlow — Documentation Hub

This folder contains project documentation. Implementation code lives in `src/` (or equivalent); authored content in `content/` (or equivalent).

## Index

| Folder / File | Purpose |
|---|---|
| `decision-log.md` | Dated accepted decisions with rationale. Append-only; orchestrator-owned. |
| `open-questions.md` | Genuinely unresolved questions. Resolved items move to the decision log. |
| `development/` | Implementer handoff packets. See `development/README.md` for the packet index. |
| `workflows/` | How-to guides for key project processes. |
| `agent-starting-prompts/` | Starting prompts for orchestrator, implementer, design-review, plan-scan, and test-coverage-scan threads. |

<!-- Add rows for schemas/, style-guides/, investigations/, retrospectives/, tooling/ as needed. -->
